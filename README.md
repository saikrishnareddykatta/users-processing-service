# Users Processing System

As a forward-thinking AWS enthusiast, I spearheaded the successful deployment of a dynamic static web application on Amazon Web Services (AWS), showcasing my prowess in both frontend and backend development.

For the frontend, I leveraged the power of React, Material UI, and Axios to craft a user-friendly and visually appealing interface. The seamless integration of these technologies not only ensured an intuitive user experience but also demonstrated my proficiency in cutting-edge frontend frameworks and libraries.

On the backend, I implemented a robust infrastructure using DynamoDB to store and manage a comprehensive data table containing user details such as name, email, phone, salary, and age. The core functionality was achieved through the seamless coordination of Lambda functions and API Gateway services, enabling the creation of a streamlined process to retrieve all user data directly within the browser.

To ensure a seamless and reliable user experience, I utilized the power of S3 buckets to host the static web application, providing a scalable and secure solution. This end-to-end project highlights my ability to design, develop, and deploy sophisticated web applications that seamlessly integrate frontend and backend technologies.

Excited to continue pushing the boundaries of cloud computing and delivering innovative solutions to drive business success.
